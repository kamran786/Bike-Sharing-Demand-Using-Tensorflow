# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Using-Tensorflow-and-LSTM

Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world. We are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

In this notebook I am using TensorFlow and Long-short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM RNN) to predict bike sharing demand by varying Network architecture, Activation function, Cost function, Epochs, Gradient estimation and Network initialization.
